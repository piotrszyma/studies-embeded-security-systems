\section{Abstract}

This report presents summary of my work done over problem set 5
during ,,Embedded Security Systems'' course Summer semester 2018/2019.

\section{Summary}

I must admit that this assignment was one of the most interesting. For the first time I had opportunity to try to break some real system. I've learned some most popular vectors of attack and how to exploit insecure implementations of systems. On one hand, this knowledgle would let me avoid similiar issues when implementing my own systems and also is a good experience that might help me cracking other systems in the future.
