\section{Abstract}

This report presents summary of my work done over problem set 6
during ,,Embedded Security Systems'' course Summer semester 2018/2019.

\section{Summary}
As a summary of the Android related work in the problem set 6, I must say that the whole ,,Android App Reverse Engineering'' webpage is a bunch of very useful and practical resources and examples of how to reverse engineer Android app. Actually, I think I will use the knowledge obtained during exercises in the immediate future, as I need to reverse engineer some application to get a bunch of endpoints that it calls. At first I thought I'd need to set up some monitoring on the network where the communication occurs (still needed to bypass encryption), but thanks to this task now I know how to easily decompile and reverse engineer Android app using tools from exercise. I hope that application I'd like to reverse won't be either some ,,JS-in-native'' or ,,fully-compiled C++'' based.
