\section{Abstract}

This report presents summary of my work done over problem sets 3 and 4
during ,,Embedded Security Systems'' course Summer semester 2018/2019.

\section{Summary}
Two assignments described in this report were my first interaction with true hardware. The third problem set showed me how the sample wireless IR communication protocols work and also how and with what kind of device can I communicate wirelessly.

During evaluation of the second assignment (problem number 4) I was programming the behaviour of Arduino platform and making it work with additional devices like IR diode or IR receiver. I've not only introduced some basic binary level communication using both wire and wireless connection, but also created some simple protocols for chat-like communication with some basic data correctness validation.

My conclusion from both problem sets is the overall view and imagination how electronic devices work and communicate with each other on the low level. That is, even if systems that we use on a daily basis are quite complex, under the hood, similarly as Arduino in those two problem sets, they perform a low level binary communication that is hidden under lot of layers of abstraction.
