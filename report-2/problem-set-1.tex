\section{Problem set 3}
\subsection{Preface}

The goal of this problem set was brief introduction to work with IrDA transmission
and how oscilloscope works.

\subsection{Assignment}

I've received two \texttt{logicdata} files with data from some remote in binary form via email from the lecturer.

\subsubsection{Analysis}

For the analysis of the program I've used two tools. First of them, ,,Saleae Logic'', has some built in protocol analyzers, but none of them was sufficient. I've analyzed the source with ,,Async Serial'' on channel 2, but it only detected many similar repeating sequences of bits \texttt{0b 1110 0000} and some data errors.

% TODO: Try to add new analyzer and analyze it using it.

The next attempt to analyze the signal was done using ,,PulseView'' program. This time, the result was positive. Thanks to that program I've concluded that the protocol used to emit the analyzed signal was \texttt{NEC}.

\subsubsection{Retransmitter}

To create retransmitter I've created a simple Arduino program using IR receiver and IR diode.

% TODO: Add more details (hehe)
