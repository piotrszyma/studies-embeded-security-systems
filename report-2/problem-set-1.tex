\section{Problem set 3}
\subsection{Preface}

The goal of this problem set was brief introduction to work with IrDA transmission
and how oscilloscope works.

\subsection{Assignment}

I've received two \texttt{logicdata} files with data from some remote in binary form
via email from the lecturer. I've opened those files using \texttt{Saleae Logic}
software as \texttt{logicdata} is a \texttt{Saleae Logic} specific binary format.
File \texttt{sample15.logicdata} contained 4 seconds of data in two channels.
Channel number 2 contained some interesting signal. I've analyzed the source on
channel 2 using ,,Async Serial'' with default values, that is: bit rate of
9600 bauds and, as it was stated as default in program, 8 bits per transfer,
1 stop bit, no partity bit, LSB sent first and not inverted. I did not use any
special mode.

As a result of analysis, in ,,Decoded protocols'' window of \texttt{Saleae Logic}
application a list of decoded protocols was displayed. Program detected many
similar repeating sequences of bits \texttt{0b 1110 0000}.

I've repated the operations mentioned before on \texttt{sample16.logicdata} and
obtained similar results. One more thing worth mentioning was that analyzer
encountered some problems during evaluation of protocols - for both logic data
files it detected some unrecognize sequences with ,,framing error''. I assumed
that was malformed data.
