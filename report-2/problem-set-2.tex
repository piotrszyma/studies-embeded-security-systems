\section{Problem set 4}
\subsection{Preface}

The goal of this problem set was to show practical examples of embedded systems.
During excercies I've learned how to setup a simple circuit using basic tools
like IR diodes, IR receivers, resistors and lot of wires. All of that was joined
and connected into \texttt{Arduino Uno} platform, which was connected to the PC
using \texttt{USB} port. I was able to create a simple programs using
\texttt{Arduino} platform to make everything work.
