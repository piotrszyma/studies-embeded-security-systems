\section{Problem set 2}
\subsection{Preface}
This problem set provided an introduction to simple pseudorandom number
generator called ,,linear-feedback shift register'' (LSFR) which is a shift
register whose input bit is a linear function of it's previous state. The goal
of this problem set was to get familiar with LSFR structure, analyze it's possible
input - initialization vector - and output generated using different IVs.

\subsection{Assignment 1}
The goal of this task was to analyze and sketch out architectures of the
\texttt{LSFR} entity provided by the lecturer.
