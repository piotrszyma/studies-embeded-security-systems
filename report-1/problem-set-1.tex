\section{Problem set 1}
\subsection{Preface}

The goal of this problem set was a brief introduction to ,,VHDL'', a hardware
description language used in electronic design automation.

\subsection{Assignment 1}

This assignment consisted of a typical introduction task - writing
,,Hello world'' program using ,,VHDL'' as it was described in ,,GHDL Quick Start
Guide'' attached to assignment description. In this task I've interacted
with first lines of code in ,,VHDL'', I got to know basic structure of program
- not yet fully understood - and how does the flow of \textit{running} the
program looks like.

\subsection{Assignment 2}

In this task I've extended program provided in ,,Quick Start Guide'' using
functionality provided by \texttt{textio} library. The goal of this task was to
create program that interacts with \texttt{stdio} - reads a line and prints it
to the console.

\subsection{Assignment 3}

Here I've learned what are the basic
